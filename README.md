# MLE_Basics & Statistics

`This will be a repository focusing on techniques and visualization to help assist in learning each task:`

`----------------------------------------`

`Common_Distr_explain`: this pdf will have R-studio code for plotting the distributions shown. There will be brief explanations for each distribution such as Binomial, Poisson, Pereto, Logistic, Gamma for example with their relevant PDF functions and use cases.

`mle_notebookBasics`: breakdown of how the MLE is used, showing by plots and explanation as well as breakdown of it using examples for derivation.

`BinomialDistr_explain`: we will cover the pdf,cdf, quantiles, functions and considerations for each. Multiple plots and examples to get a general idea.

`Chi Square Distribution Explained`: This will cover a lot; pdf, csf, goodness of fit test, test for independence, plotting everything. Simple explanations and some help with what to pay attention to.
